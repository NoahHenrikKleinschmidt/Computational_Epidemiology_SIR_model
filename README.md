This project models the effect of a variety of subgroups within a population on disease dynamics. To that end an SIR model was developed that models a susceptible population of various subgroups that differ in their infection rate, recovery rate, death rate, and/or relapsation rate (loss of immunity). More details on the system of differential equations implemented in this project are available on the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/NoahHenrikKleinschmidt/Computation_Epidemiology_HS21) Repository of this project.
